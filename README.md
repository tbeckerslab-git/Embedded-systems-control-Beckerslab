# Machine-Learning and Control Theory integration

![Production Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Production%20State-In%20Progress-orange)

## Description
This repository contains the integrated control system code for controlling a Dynamixel motor, 
interfacing with a FLIR camera, and implementing a port-Hamiltonian machine learning model. 
The machine learning model utilizes feedback from the FLIR camera and dispatches output commands to the Dynamixel motor, guiding 
it to act accordingly. The synchronization and integration of these components are achieved using ROS (Robot Operating System). This is accomplished with the help
of two sub repositories linked below.


## Sub-Repositories Included
1. [Dynamixel SDK](https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/DynamixelSDK.git)
2. [FLIR Camera Driver](https://github.com/ros-drivers/flir_camera_driver.git)
